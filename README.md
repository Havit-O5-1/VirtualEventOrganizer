# VirtualEventOrganizer
Currently a work in progress but this will be a cloud based application that will help with creating events via computer/phones so that it would be easier for people to organize their plans much better in the future.

I made a mistake when uploading the files, I had two different workspaces for the codes
The following files dubbed calendar html, index html, register html, app py, and users db are meant to have their own workspace in python when running the code in order to ensure the registration page is up and running.
The rest of the files are all connected in their own workspace folder in python to run mongodb which is the personal cloud i use.
